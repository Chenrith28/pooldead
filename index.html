  <li><h3>Deadpool started lif as parody of a DC character</h3><p>The idea for Deadpool was originally conceived by artist Rob Liefeld after reading DC’s “Teen Titans” comics and becoming fascinated with the antagonist Deathstroke, a morally-ambiguous mercenary with superhuman agility and expert weapon skills.</p></li>
  <li><h3>Deadpool started life as a villain</h3><p>Deadpool isn’t exactly a typical clear-cut goody-two-shoes type of hero. He’s a mercenary and often immoral, but he’s easy to root for and not exactly a villain either.</p></li>
   <li><h3>The first solo run was released in 1993</h3><p>After his first appearance in “New Mutants”, the character went on to make guest appearances in other Marvel titles like “The Avengers”, “Daredevil”, and “Heroes for Hire.” His popularity subsequently rose.Then in August 1993, Marvel released Deadpool’s inaugural solo mini-series, “The Circle Chase.” He received another starring mini-run one year later, followed by his first ongoing series in 1997.</p></li>
<li><h3>He can't die.</h3><p>Over the years, Deadpool has been shot, stabbed, decapitated, and incinerated. However, thanks to his supreme healing powers, he’s more or less impossible to kill. On top of that, Thanos used the Infinity Stones to curse Wilson with immortality in order to prevent him from dying and living happily ever after with a certain character…</p></li>
<li><h3>He's in love with death</h3><p>Deadpool and Lady Death had a thing. Unlike most people who want to date dead things, though, this wasn’t solely about exploring any depraved carnal passions.They caught the feels for each other. She appeared to him during moments of extreme torture, but in order to be together, our hero had to die and stay dead. But Thanos was also in love with Death at the time and jealous of her infatuation with Deadpool.</p></li>
